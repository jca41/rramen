    "ingredients": [
      "4 pounds pork neck bones",
      "One pig trotter",
      "One whole chicken, broken down, breasts removed",
      "One large white onion, roughly chopped",
      "10 garlic cloves",
      "One two inch long piece of ginger, peeled",
      "water as needed"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Take the pork neck bones and pig trotter, and blanch them in boiling water for around 10-20 minutes, or until scum stops rising. This blanch helps to clean the pork of its “funk” and keeps the stock clear.",
      "Dump the blanching water, and rinse the bones of any residual scum.",
      "Add the bones and foot back to the pot, along with the chicken and aromatics, and cover with water by at least two inches.",
      "Bring the stock to a boil, then down to the tiiiiiiniest of simmers (like, barely a bubble breaks the surface, just occasionally blubbing up) around 176-190 degrees F, and cover. The higher your temp gets before an actual boil, the better your collagen conversion to gelatin will be. Cook at this temperature for at least 6 hours, but preferably 10 hours. Don’t stir! It’ll cloud the stock! This is very delicate and any agitation will emulsify particulate.",
      "Strain the solids. Reserve until needed."
