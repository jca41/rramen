  "intro": "> ***Miso ramen*** is my favorite. Hands down. I love miso ramen with a serious burning passion, and spend most of my time trying to identify ways to improve my recipe. It’s taken over 5 years so far, and I still learn every day.\n>\n> Without question, I learned this love in Japan. I lived in Sapporo for a while, and there, miso ramen is king. From legends like Junren and Sumire to smaller 3rd wave shops like Ichi-Ryu An and Saimi, there is a plethora of miso ramen. It’s everywhere, and every Sapporoan has their favorite shop.\n>\n> But even with this base of miso in the tare being relatively consistent, the shops differ greatly in their preperation of the dish. Perhaps the most noticable difference is the use of (or lack of) a wok, to stir fry vegetables in lard and then almost deglaze the wok with the broth. Conversely, many shops simply add the miso tare and aroma oil to the bowl, pour over stock, and whisk briefly to combine",

      "description": "Over the last few years I’ve forgone the double soup method in favor of a simple “Animal-style” (doubutsu-kei) style broth. It’s extremely simple.",
      "ingredients": [
        "4 pounds pork neck bones",
        "One pig trotter",
        "One whole chicken, broken down, breasts removed",
        "One large white onion, roughly chopped",
        "10 garlic cloves",
        "One two inch long piece of ginger, peeled",
        "water as needed"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Take the pork neck bones and pig trotter, and blanch them in boiling water for around 10-20 minutes, or until scum stops rising. This blanch helps to clean the pork of its “funk” and keeps the stock clear.",
        "Dump the blanching water, and rinse the bones of any residual scum.",
        "Add the bones and foot back to the pot, along with the chicken and aromatics, and cover with water by at least two inches.",
        "Bring the stock to a boil, then down to the tiiiiiiniest of simmers (like, barely a bubble breaks the surface, just occasionally blubbing up) around 176-190 degrees F, and cover. The higher your temp gets before an actual boil, the better your collagen conversion to gelatin will be. Cook at this temperature for at least 6 hours, but preferably 10 hours. Don’t stir! It’ll cloud the stock! This is very delicate and any agitation will emulsify particulate.",
        "Strain the solids. Reserve until needed."

      "name": "Tare",
      "description": "Miso tare is deceptive, but easy if you can find good miso. Please don’t use American miso or miso powder, it’s just not the same quality and you’ll be disappointed. All miso tare comprises of, at its basic level, is a combination of the following ingredients in a bowl.",
      "ingredients": [
        "Miso of various types (totaling 2 cups, typically at least 50% white/kome miso. I generally blend 3 misos: a Shinshu, another white of some kind, and a nice Red or Wheat forward variant)",
        "1.5 tbsp tahini",
        "4-8 grated garlic cloves (entirely up to you)",
        "One two inch long piece of ginger, grated",
        "One half white onion, pureed",
        "2 tbs soy sauce (though more if needed)",
        "1 tbsp of sesame oil",

        "Sapporo noodles are fairly minerally, chewy, and curly. So I up the water content, gluten content, and alkaline content to promote more chew and flavor than a standard Tokyo noodle. Some Sapporo ramen noodles also have egg white (around 1 egg white per 500 grams flour), but I haven’t played with this much. If you were interested, simply replace some of the water with equal weight egg white",
        "Per portion: <i>measure everything by weight</i>"
      ],
      "ingredients": [
        "98.5g King Arthur bread flour (12.7% protein by weight)",
        "1.5 g vital wheat gluten (aprox 77.5% protein by weight)",
        "42 g water",
        "1 g salt",
        "1.5 g baked soda",
        "Optional: a pinch of Riboflavin (this adds color, I estimate it entirely)"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Add baked soda and salt (and riboflavin if using) to the water, dissolve completely. I like to add one at a time, it seems like the baked soda dissolves better if added prior to the salt.",
        "In the food processor, add your wheat gluten and flour. Pulse a few times to combine the two.",
        "While running the food processor, add your water mixture slowly, in an even stream. Occasionally, stop to scrape the sides down. You know you're set when you have tiny grain like pieces.",
        "Cover the food processor and let this rest for 30 minutes. This gives the flour granules time to fully absorb the water and alkaline salts.",
        "Knead it. Currently I use an electric pasta machine to sheet the dough, going through the largest setting, then the 2nd, then the 3rd, then folding and repassing through the largest setting. I repass two to three times, or until I notice the dough is making the machine work really hard. I also like to fold the dough the same direction each time. Some articles I read suggested this kept the gluten strands running in the same direction, which promotes better texture. You'll notice interesting horizontal lines running along the length of your dough if you do it right. If this isn’t an option for you, I used to throw the mix into a plastic bag and step on it repeatedly, which simulates the kneading process used in an industrial setting.",
        "When smooth, cover with plastic, and rest at room temp for an hour. This gives the gluten time to relax, and “ripens” the dough according to Japanese cooks.",
        "Pull out your dough. Portion into workable sizes (around one serving's worth), and roll out to desired thickness, using potato starch as you go to prevent sticking. Do this with a pasta machine, it is borderline impossible without a machine. An electric one will save you an incredible amount of effort.",
        "Cut your noodles to your desired thickness.",
        "Take a handful of finished noodles and squeeze the noodles together into a tight ball, like a snowball, then shimmy them around to create the classic wavy effect. Repeat until crinkled to your liking.",
        "Ideally you should make these noodles in advance. Sapporo noodles are best after around 2 days in the fridge. They firm up a bit and develop more flavor. The general rule for this cure is that the higher the hydration, the longer the wait. You can, of course, also bag them up and freeze them; they freeze extremely well."
