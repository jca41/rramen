  "intro": "Somehow, in all of the weird ramen I’ve been making, I have not posted a tsukemen recipe before. But y’all have been asking for it. And I finally have a good one. So here’s a rendition.\n\nNow, I should clarify. Tsukemen can exist in a crazy variety. And it would be impossible for me to break that down in this post. Some tsukemen has tonkotsu, fish powder, all sorts of ingredients. Today, we’ll be focusing on:\n\n1. Noodles\n2. Taishoken-era chintan dipping broth.\n\nThe noodles and broth in this recipe are definitely more modern, but they pay homage to the original. Taishoken is the inventor of the dish, but their noodles are similar in a lot of ways to standard ramen noodles, so the recipe is atypical in that regard. Further, the broth isn’t quiiiite like Taishoken, I think it has more refinement and is cleaner overall. Still, it good tho. Let’s break it down."
